Read more about the motivation and process on my blog: <https://kofi.sexy/blog/multi>.


## Quick Start

```bash
./create-mac-app <YOUR_APP_NAME> <YOUR_ICON_PNG_PATH>
open <YOUR_APP_NAME>.app/Contents/Resources/config.json # edit your app's websites
open <YOUR_APP_NAME>.app # open and use your custom app
```

These instructions were developed and tested with Swift 4.2 on macOS 10.13 High Sierra.


## Common Issues

If you (1) have XCode installed and (2) see one of these errors when running `create-mac-app`:

-
  ```
  error: terminated(72): xcrun --sdk macosx --find xctest output:
      xcrun: error: unable to find utility "xctest", not a developer tool or in PATH
  ```
-
  ```
  dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/llbuild.framework/Versions/A/llbuild
  Referenced from: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/swift-package 
      Reason: image not found
      Abort trap: 6
  ```

Try this fix, which tells XCode Command Line Tools where to find the most up-to-date libraries:

```
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```
